# Architectural Overview of the Collaborative Multi-Modal Agentic Framework for Business Intelligence

## Introduction
The Collaborative Multi-Modal Agentic Framework for Business Intelligence is designed to integrate various data modalities and agentic behaviors to enhance decision-making processes in business environments. This document outlines the architecture of the framework, detailing its components, interactions, and design principles.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Backend
- **API**: Implements RESTful endpoints using FastAPI or Node.js to handle client requests and serve data.
- **Config**: Manages configuration settings, including environment variables and application settings.
- **Services**: Encapsulates business logic, interacting with databases and external APIs to process requests.
- **Utils**: Provides utility functions that support various backend operations.

### 2. Frontend
- **Components**: Reusable React components that form the building blocks of the user interface.
- **Pages**: Defines the main structure of the application, routing, and layout.
- **Styles**: Contains styling resources, including CSS and styled-components for UI design.
- **Utils**: Utility functions that assist in frontend operations.

### 3. Data
- **Raw**: Stores raw data samples for training and testing purposes.
- **Processed**: Contains cleaned and processed data ready for analysis.
- **Schemas**: Defines data schemas for validation and consistency checks.

### 4. Models
- **Trained**: Houses trained model artifacts and weights.
- **Scripts**: Contains scripts for training and fine-tuning machine learning models.
- **Configs**: Configuration files for model parameters and settings.

### 5. Agents
- **Core**: Implements fundamental agent functionalities.
- **Multi-Modal**: Supports agents that can process and analyze different types of data.
- **Collaborative**: Facilitates agents working together to achieve common goals.

### 6. Ingestion
- **Sources**: Defines various data sources for ingestion.
- **Pipelines**: ETL pipelines for data ingestion, including processes like OCR and speech-to-text.
- **Transformers**: Data transformation tools used during the ingestion process.

### 7. Retrieval
- **Indexes**: Index files for efficient data retrieval.
- **Queries**: Query definitions for data access.
- **Engines**: Implementations of retrieval engines, such as vector databases.

### 8. Orchestration
