# Collaborative Multi-Modal Agentic Framework for Business Intelligence

## Overview
The Collaborative Multi-Modal Agentic Framework for Business Intelligence is designed to integrate various data modalities and collaborative agents to enhance business intelligence capabilities. This framework leverages advanced machine learning models, data ingestion pipelines, and orchestration mechanisms to provide actionable insights and automate decision-making processes.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- **backend**: Contains the server-side logic, including API endpoints, configuration, services, and utility functions.
- **frontend**: Houses the client-side application built with React, including components, pages, styles, and utilities.
- **data**: Manages data resources, including raw data, processed data, and schemas for validation.
- **models**: Contains trained models, training scripts, and configuration files for model parameters.
- **agents**: Implements various types of agents, including core functionalities, multi-modal processing, and collaborative capabilities.
- **ingestion**: Defines data sources, ETL pipelines, and transformers for data ingestion.
- **retrieval**: Manages data retrieval mechanisms, including indexes, queries, and engines.
- **orchestration**: Coordinates workflows, scheduling, and monitoring of agent activities.
- **forecasting**: Includes models, data preparation scripts, and evaluators for forecasting tasks.
- **automation**: Automates tasks and workflows through scripts, triggers, and logs.
- **evaluation**: Contains metrics, tests, and reports for evaluating models and agents.
- **deployment**: Manages deployment configurations, including Docker and Kubernetes setups.
- **documentation**: Provides API documentation, user guides, and architectural details.
